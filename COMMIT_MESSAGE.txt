fix(document-processing): implement document listing for managers

Fixes critical bug where managers could not see documents they uploaded.
The getDocumentsByOriginManager() method was a stub that always returned
an empty array, preventing managers from retrieving their documents.

Changes:
- Add findByOriginManagerId() to DocumentRepositoryPort interface
- Implement findByOriginManagerId() in DocumentRepositoryAdapter with
  proper TypeORM query, soft-delete filtering, and pagination support
- Replace stub implementation in getDocumentsByOriginManager() to call
  the new repository method
- Fix test expectations for user upload behavior (users without assigned
  managers can upload as temporary origin managers)
- Fix test timeouts for status checking tests (increased to 3min/2min)
- Fix fields response structure in tests (use .fields property)
- Improve test logging for document listing debugging

Impact:
- Managers can now see documents they uploaded via GET /v1/documents
- Test suite passes consistently
- Better error visibility through improved logging

Fixes: Document listing returning empty array for managers
Test: test/document-processing/full-workflow.e2e-spec.ts
