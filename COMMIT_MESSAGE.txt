feat(anythingllm): implement automatic user provisioning with workspace assignment

Implement HIPAA-compliant automatic user provisioning from Keystone to AnythingLLM,
including user creation, workspace assignment, and suspension synchronization via
service-to-service admin APIs.

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Added new database migration for anythingllm_user_mappings table
- UsersService now requires AnythingLLMUserProvisioningService dependency

Features:
- Automatic user provisioning on user creation, update, and suspension
- Workspace creation and assignment using deterministic slug generation
- User mapping persistence for idempotent provisioning operations
- Asynchronous fire-and-forget provisioning to prevent user-facing delays
- Comprehensive audit logging for all provisioning events
- HIPAA-compliant implementation (no PHI in logs, secure password handling)

New Components:
- AnythingLLMUserProvisioningService: Core provisioning logic with retry support
- WorkspaceMapperService: Deterministic workspace slug generation from user IDs
- AnythingLLMUserMapping entity and repository for mapping persistence
- Database migration: CreateAnythingLLMUserMappings1767000000000
- E2E test suite: user-provisioning.e2e-spec.ts with full workflow coverage

Integration Points:
- UsersService.create(): Triggers provisioning after user creation
- UsersService.update(): Syncs status changes (suspension) to AnythingLLM
- UsersService.remove(): Triggers suspension sync before soft-delete
- Uses existing AnythingLLMAdminService for API calls
- Leverages service identity authentication for secure API access

Refactorings and Improvements:
- Enhanced access control service with improved error handling
- Improved audit service with better query capabilities and PHI sanitization
- Refined document processing with better state machine handling
- Updated manager architecture with cleaner domain services
- Enhanced revocation service with improved domain logic
- Improved test utilities and helpers across all E2E test suites
- Updated test constants and configuration for better maintainability

Technical Details:
- Provisioning is asynchronous and non-blocking (fire-and-forget pattern)
- Idempotent operations: checks for existing mappings before creating
- Error handling: logs errors without failing user operations
- Workspace slugs use SHA-256 hash of user ID for deterministic generation
- Supports relational databases only (document DB support TODO)
- All provisioning events are audited via AuditService

Testing:
- Comprehensive E2E test suite covering full provisioning workflow
- Tests user creation, workspace assignment, status sync, and deletion
- Includes service identity authentication verification
- Tests handle asynchronous provisioning with polling mechanism

Documentation:
- Updated AnythingLLM service identity VM setup documentation
- Added inline documentation for HIPAA compliance considerations
- Added TODO comments for future improvements (bounded executor, document DB support)
